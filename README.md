    <h1>Event Management System</h1>
    <p>
        This <strong>Event Management System</strong> is a console-based application developed in C++. It allows two types of users—<strong>Admins</strong> and <strong>Users</strong>—to manage events through a basic text interface.
    </p>

    <h2>Key Features:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Admin Login:</strong> Allows predefined admins to log in and view all event details.</li>
        <li><strong>User Registration and Login:</strong> Enables users to sign up and log in with their credentials.</li>
        <li><strong>Event Booking:</strong> Logged-in users can book events by entering details such as event name, type, date, time, budget, and number of attendees.</li>
        <li><strong>View Booked Events:</strong> Users can view events they have booked.</li>
        <li><strong>Input Validation:</strong> Ensures valid user input using C++ standard input checking.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Class Structure:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Event Class:</strong> Handles event data input and output.</li>
        <li><strong>Admin Class:</strong> Inherits from Event and manages admin login and event overview.</li>
        <li><strong>User Class:</strong> Inherits from Event and manages user signup, login, and viewing personal event records.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Technologies Used:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>C++ (Standard Library)</li>
        <li>OOP Concepts (Inheritance, Static Members)</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
        This project demonstrates core object-oriented programming skills and basic input handling, making it suitable for beginners learning C++ through real-world applications.
